An aggregator for international soccer teams. Written in a few weeks as a final project for RefactorU.

I wrote this as a final project for RefactorU -- back in the days before I understood things like Webpack or Babel.

The code isn't as clean as I might like it to be (again, this project was written before I had much professional experience) but compared to my last project (Zappeur) I think that I did a better job of anticipating data structures and creating a harmonious connection between front and back end.

Probably the thing that I'm most proud about is that I was able to follow the timetable that I set for myself, meaning that I had enough time before presenting to test the app.
